# Auto-mealbooking
Automatically book meals on current Caius system

You will need to create a file called config.txt that contains your CRSid on the first line, your Raven password on the second line, Yes or No on the third line to indicate whether you want to book a special formal, and the full name of this formal on the fourth line (or put NA if you don't want to book any special formal).

HOWTO: python main.py

The function WhichMeal() puts certain restrictions on which meal should be booked. Please edit this to suit your schedule.
